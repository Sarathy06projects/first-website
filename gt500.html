	<h3>Ford Origins:</h3>
	    <p>Henry Ford built his first experimental car in a workshop behind his home in Detroit in 1896. After formation of the Ford Motor Company, the first Ford car, the original Model A, was assembled at the Mack Avenue plant in July 1903.</p>  
	    <p>Ford Motor Company, American automotive corporation founded in 1903 by Henry Ford and 11 associate investors. In 1919 the company was reincorporated, with Ford, his wife, Clara, and his son, Edsel, acquiring full ownership; they, their heirs, and the Ford Foundation (formed 1936) were sole stockholders until January 1956, when public sale of the common stock was first offered. The company manufactures passenger cars and trucks as well as automotive parts and accessories.</p> For additional information <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ford-Motor-Company" target="blank"><u>click here</u></a> </p>

	<h3>Ford Mustag shelby GT500</h3>
	<div class="c1">
	<p>If you're a Mustang fan, the GT500 is one of those cars that you've been waiting for with bated breath. If you're not, and only remember the GT500 as an overpowered sports car with wayward handling and an unwarranted pop-culture following courtesy of films like Gone in 60 Seconds, the Shelby GT500 could very well change your opinion of the Mustang entirely. Powered by a 5.2-liter supercharged V8 with a whopping 760 horsepower and 625 lb-ft of torque, the Shelby GT500 is still an insanely powerful beast, only now it knows what to do with all that grunt</p></div>

	<p>GT500 with its standard summer tires as well as the ultra-sticky rubber offered with the Carbon Fiber Track package, which includes 20-inch carbon-fiber wheels. The latter was part of a comparison test with the 650-hp Chevy Camaro ZL1 1LE and 797-hp Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. While during testing the Shelby's base wheel-and-tire setup actually provided better acceleration (hitting 60 mph in 3.4 seconds versus 3.6), the upgraded rolling stock contributed to higher cornering grip (1.13 g versus 0.99) and a shorter stop from 70 mph (142 feet versus 150). Optimized for racetrack duty, the Shelby GT500 proved that modern muscle cars can post quicker lap times than more exotic machines, such as the Porsche 718 Cayman GT4­­ and Lamborghini Huracán Evo, at the most recent running of our annual Lightning Lap event. Even when the ultimate Mustang isn't blasting down drag strips or terrorizing six-figure sports cars at the track, it makes daily driving extra exciting with its soil-your-shorts acceleration and surprisingly agile handling, considering its two-ton curb weight. Despite its racy demeanor, the GT500's standard adaptive dampers provide a merciful ride quality, too.</p>
